# Quantum_dots_cellular_automata
This qiskit program attempts to simulate quantum gates from scratch. It is derived from the motivation of using quantum dots as cells in Quantum Cellular Automata.
In this qiskit program, I simulate a toffoli gate using single qubits, which interact with their adjacent qubits.
